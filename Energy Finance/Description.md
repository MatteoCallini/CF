The aim of this project is to calibrate an HJM model on German electricity swaps and price
structured pay-offs options by means of Monte Carlo simulation.
We firstly briefly introduce the concept of swap contract in the energy market. There are three
fundamental dates in this type of agreements: the first one is the date in which the contract is
stipulated, which we usually tend to consider as t = 0, we then have τ1 which is the moment
in which the owner of the contract receives a constant flow of the commodity, having payed a
fixed payment for unit. Lastly, we consider τ2 which is the maturity of the contract.
Our objective is to price this type of contracts using the Heath-Jarrow-Turnbull approach.
