The objective of this project is to build portfolios using different allocation strategies and
discuss their performances, using as investment universe 11 sector indices and 5 factor indices
of the S&P500. We will analyze three different categories: cyclical, defensive and sensitive.
We will be working with the prices of the 11 sectors and the 5 factors indices, focusing specifically
on values for 2023.
